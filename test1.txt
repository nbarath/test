This is promoted to PrePro and Production well before 4AM EST. 
Later, I copied geozones of district 15 to district 46. 
Tested in production as Manasa is on leave. It is working fine.
Geozones can not have same geozone ID in db table as per database condition. And, arrival reports works based on school number. We need to check how the arrivals are reported for district 46 in district 15 report.

WP-689 - 6h - T6h
This is done in both Tiger1 and Tiger2 servers.
I followed the document for tiger data import as well as the instruction provided by DBA during last TN data import.
AR tiger data is imported in both the Tiger servers and I tested it for some random locations. It is working fine.
Importing multiple state data will work but, it will take more time and we may end up with completing multiple state data in Tiger1 server. This will not be useful unless it is done in Tiger2 server. So, I worked on AR data to complete in both the tiger servers.

WP-682 - 2h - T1h
I working on this.
I am not able to reproduce the issue in the production. I tried in local, it is working. Please recreate this in the call.

WP-681
Arrival report is working based on geozone ID and school numbers. We are using school numbers to find the assignments. Since, we have same school number in district 20, we are seeing assignments in district 15 report. As we have not copied the geozones to district 20, it is not reporting the arrivals.
In district 46, we have copied the geozones, hopefully arrival report should work. Report for this district needs to be tested.

I reviewed the code with Anubhav and no comments.

WP-682 When running the All Schools arrival reports (both versions) - the last columns shakes when hovering over this
I worked on this task.
When we have less number of records in tooltip, it is not flickering on hover. 
When there are more number of records to display in tooltip, browser brings the vertical scrol to show the tooltip content on hover, 
and this causes the shaking issue. 
I need UI developer help as it is more on UI issue.

WP-695 VeoNow Password Reset Requests are being sent from WTB
I am working on this.
I checked coding for reset password. Emails are sent using support@wheresthebus.com. Email for veonow is not originally implemented there.

We are sending emails noticiation to wheresthebus@trigent.com, ryan.hill@wheresthebus.com, joe.winkler@hotmail.com as well, Which email it has to use if it is from veonow.com?

I worked on this task.
I checked the code and functionalities in realtime page and also observed the browser console status.
I don't see any other changes can help to reduce the the page speed.

Summary :
1. Master icon file resizing stuff and reverted from production as it did not help via www.wheresthebus.com
2. Minifying javascript file size, it did not help here.
3. Excluding route master icon files in page load. It helped only when route number option is not selected in 'Display' button

I checked the wrapping issue. This is happening only in "All Schools (all bus arrivals)" report and not in "All Schools (assigned buses)" report.
I have addressed this issue in "All Schools (all bus arrivals)" and this is available in staging. 
Now, there is a cut on right side of the tooltip pop up.

I worked with UI developer on this ticket.
UI developer spend some time today on addressing the pop up cut issue. Looks like, the plugin used to show the tooltip content, is causing the issue.
I will work with him to address the issue.


WP-704 - 5h - T7h
I am working on this issue.
It is little chalenging to find exactly what factor is causing the issue. We are correctly using email credential & smtp based on WTB or Veonow.
I created a sample test email and sent it from application. They are also marked as spam. 
Need to find what is causing the isse and then solution.

26-Jun-2018

WP-682 - 2h - T2h
I worked with UI developer Adhiyamaan.
We tried possibilities to remove the right side cut. None of them did not work out.
We tried customizing the tooltip plugin then tried showing the tooltip popup on left side later arrival count(link), we got the flickering issue again.
So we reverted todays update.

WP-704 - 4h - T5h
I worked on this issue.
I tried running test mail script in production for both wheresthebus.com and veonow.com.
Looks like, we don't have to do anything with this issue. Even a test email from application using WTB/Veono SMTP creadentials, are marked as spam by Gmail.
I had discussed this issue with Vijendra. Suresh asked Vijendra to raise a ticket with Gmail. Vijendra is working on this.

WP-674 - 1h - T2h
I worked on this issue.
I checked required permission to create new bus icons in image folder, we are missing again. I have given the permission.
I am not sure what server activity removed the given permission.
Once, we move to AWS with php 7 updates, there image folder will be in Amazon S3 and we will not get the permission issue 
that we are currently facing in php7 server

I worked on this task.
Manasa reported two issues, those are addressed and available in php7 server.
1. We were getting errors during new user sign up, existing user update and validating user in user details page.
This is addressed.
2. We did not receive new user registration emails from php7 server, but it is working fine in php5. 
Debugged this issue and found that php7 server is configured to send new user registration emails only to 
'anubhav_j@trigent.com,ryan.hill@wheresthebus.com'. I modified this 'wheresthebus@trigent.com,ryan.hill@wheresthebus.com,nbarathmca@gmail.com'

I am working on this task.
1. Keep alive
By enabling keep alive, browser can be get multiple resouces using single connection to server. 
This is very important thing to be done. I believe, this change can help in reducing the initial page load time.
https://blog.stackpath.com/glossary/keep-alive/
I checked this keep alive setting in app.wheresthebus.com & php.wheresthebus.com, it is active. It is not active only for wheresthebus.com & veonow.com

I remember there was a conversation on keep alive property with Vijendra & Suresh. I could not get those email threads due to hard disc crash. Please check
2.Defer Parsing of Javascript
Most of Javascript files are required for initial page load. There can be few javascript files, which can be loaded separately. 
This might help little in page load. We can give a try.
3. Minify Javascript
We have already tried this for the custom javascript files created by developers. We can try minify the library javascript files. This might help little in page load.
Note : 
We can do #2 & #3 changes and test only in the production as wheresthebus.com takes time than other environment. I can create a debugging file for the existing bus realtime page. 
So that customers will not have any impact.

I am working on this.

I created yahoo account to test the how it behaves in other emails. It is not marking WTB emails as spam, but, sometime, it marks the veonow emails as spam.

I created separate php script to debug the issue as per Vijendra's instruction. And, tested with that.

Is this only marked as spam in Gmail? Are other email clients fine?
-- WTB emails are marked as spam only in  Gmail. I created a yahoo mail account, there WTB mails are not marked as spam.

If it was in the code, I would suspect it would affect all email clients. 
-- I am checking this.

Could it be due to them being sent from Gmail and Gmail is flagging them somehow? 
-- I don't think. Becuase, the WTB email sent from Gmail, is not marked as spam in yahoo mail.

I assume the VeoNow emails are not being marked as spam is this correct? 
-- This is not consistent. Sometime, mails are received marked as spam in Gmail and Yahoo mail.

Tomorrow, I will work with Vijendra to fix the issue.

I debugged the spam issue in production and staging environments of wheresthebus.com & veonow.com in browser. And, also checked on emails sent from linux console.
It is working fine, emails are not marked as spam. I have not made any code change for this.
And, also checked the forgot password functionality for both wheresthebus.com and veonow.com. It works fine.
I discussed the working status of email with Vijendra. He suspects our mail id should have been marked as spam due mass emails sent from tablet server while setting up email(Suresh) a few weeks back
and now gmail would have white listed it.
Let's put this ticket 'On Hold' and observe the emails.

Yes Ryan, I am following your order list. And, during last archieve also, I followed same order.
I am working on this task. 
I am executing the script for 2017. I am randomly checking the backup data.
Backup script execution was suddenly stopped in the server while processing district 22 data. I checked the server load, disc space, error logs. I could not find what caused backup script termination.
I modified the script coding to start with district 22 again. It is running in the server.
I have created an excel from log to track number records backed up for each district in 2017. I will share the excel once the backup process is completed.
Do you want to track the number of records of district for each month in 2017?

So, I did not delete 2016 data and deleted only 2017 data for district 11. Please confirm.

WP-739 1.5 -- 2.5
As discussed in yesterday' call, we are going to have an additional column for driver image path in driver_details table.  And, driver ID will be the name of driver images. Existing driver image will be overwritten when new driver image is uploaded for same driver ID.
Driver images will be stored in a predefined location of php application server when the images are read from bulk upload folder and updated in driver_details table. It is assumed that driver ID is used as image file name in initial bulk upload folder.
I discussed with Shilpa on showing these driver images in tablets.  Shilpa has to copy driver image from predefined location using image path column value (driver_details table)
Next, I will create a php script to read images for a district from bulk upload folder and to saves in predefined location, it will also upadate the image path in driver_details table.
Please upload the bulk image folder when it is ready.

I am working on this.
I have added a new column driver_image in driver_details table.
I created a new php script to copy driver images from bulk upload folder to predefined location, then it updates driver_image column in driver_details table.
Updates are in my local. I need to test this.
driver images are uploaded in : /home/wtbuser/Barath/driver_images/district_XX/
Driver images are saved in /var/www/wheresthebus.com/code/public/resources/images/driver_images/district_XX/
Yesterday, I discussed with Shilpa about updates on images. We need to figure out that. I have an idea of adding a new column is_image_sync to driver_details
table. When there is an update in php side on driver image, the column will be set to 0, once Shilpa copies the image, then she can set it to 1. 
So that, in next sync, she can ignore images have is_image_sync as 0. I will discuss this will Shipla tomorrow.

I had discussion with Shilpa, Vijendra and Karthi. Vijendra suggested new approach. <Shilpa> has mentioned the approach in WM-268. 
We need to have a new column to track modified date and time of driver images in driver_details table.
We have a few questions from discussion,
#1 Sample images are in jpg format. All original images will be in same format or some can have jpg and other can have differnt image format. 
#2 What would be the maximum size of image file.
#3 After initial bulk upload of driver image, when we upload drive image again in future, will that contains delta driver images. 
For example, initially we upload images for 400 driver of district 31. Later, 50 driver images get changed, 
that case, only 50 driver images(delta) will be uploaded or all 400 driver images including 50 driver images will be uploaded.

I checked master icon cron. It ran well. It took 58 mins to complete. As I discussed yesterday, I assume this delay is because of the images are coming from S3. I will discuss this slowness issue with Vijendra.
I worked on this task.
I had a discussion with Vijendra. The slowness of master icon cron is because of reading images from S3 takes long time.
Reading an individual bus icon is an API call to S3. When we read bus icons to create master icon file, it takes more time.
Vijendra told, when the master icon cron starts, instead of reading bus icons from S3, we can create them on fly and store them into a temporary image folder and once master icon files are created then the temporary image folder will be deleted. This is a temporary fix and it requires code change in master icon file logic.
Vijendra also suggested, we would go for some alternate approach to show bus numbers(like icon) over map than using bus icon images / master icon images. He will look more into that.

I have tested the master icon cron in my local then promoted to  staging and tested. It is working fine.
While creating each bus icon, code refers icon templates (blank icon) from S3, I modified the logic to copy those files to the tmp folder as part of master conr as it is an additional call to S3 for each bus icon creation on fly.

WP-777 2h - 3h
I worked with Manasa on testing.
Yesterday, icons were displaying correctly in realtime page when I tested. 
After that, S3 image folder was mounted to staging and it has permissions issues. So icons are not working properly in staging now.
I will check with [~anubhav_j].

As discussed with Anubhav, giving permissions to all the images, might take very long time (in days). 
To continue with the testing, we removed S3 image link from staging application code. Once the testing is done, then we will link S3 image folder again to staging application code with required permissions.
I reran the master cron in staging. Now, it is working fine.

WP-790 5h - 6h
I worked on this task.
In staging db, I cleared all the existing school geozones of district 20 and copied the school geozones for district 15. All other geozones of district 20 remains same.
Past school arrivals are not avaialble for district 20 as district 20 got new school geozones ids. 
I fixed the code issues for district 20 in arrival report. We can test the report for district 20 once we get new school arrivals.
Shall I promote to production tomorrow?

Backup of geozones and school_arrival tables are taken in production db. District 15 school geozones are copied to district 20. Old schools geozones and arrivals are cleared from db table. Fix for district 20 "All Schools (assigned buses)" also promoted to production.
manasa_r, please check.
Regarding Manasa's Observation, I discussed with Manasa & [~prakash_p], there is a nightly cron which updates the bus numbers in geozone table.

WP-777 2.5h
No, the updates done in the staging, did not affect the production.

It looks like master icon cron did not run well in the production. While processing route master files, cron had some issues. I checked the master icon cron log, but I could not find the reason. I have set to load icon individually and not from master icon file due to cron issue.

14-Aug-2018

WP-777 - 1h - 1.5h
This was promoted to production around 3.15AM EST and informed Manasa.
In production, I checked around 5.50AM EST and found icons via have master file, having cut issue in realtime page. So, I set to load icons individually and not from master file. I is working now.
 !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail! 
I am not sure, is this master icon cron issue or something impacted from the S3 images mounting stuff done by Vijendra.
I will check the master cron tomorrow in off time.

WP-815 - 5h - 6.5h
Yes, I worked on this task today. Now, it is working fine.
I checked email application functionality using email test script that I created for WP-788 testing. Using SMTP debugging mode, I found that the emails are being blocked by google when they are sent from the application. Google blocks the email based on "Allow less secure apps" setting. This setting was turned off for veonow.com.  Veonow emails were working fine when we promoted WP-788 on 08/03. I am not aware when the setting was modified and who modified it.
I discussed with Vijendra and he turned on this setting as it requires admin privilege to change the settings.
[~manasa_r] tested it, veonow emails are working fine.
No promotion to production as there is not code changes involves here. I discussed with Vijendra and he modified Gmail setting "Allow less secure apps" only for support@veonow.com. This was done around 5.30AM EST.

WP-739 - 30m -1h
[~prena_m], As we discussed, I have uploaded driver id 100008 of district 31 with a sample image. This is available in staging db and production S3 bucket.

WP-777 - 0h - 1h
[~manasa_r], please check this updage in production today.
Note : Images are not read from S3 as Vijendra copied S3 images to PHP server and mounted PHP server images to APP server. So, time taken by cron can be considered only when images are mounted from S3 again.

WP-812 - 6h - 8h
I worked on this issue.
We are making API calls to Synovia every minute. Usually, Synovia sends the response quickly, but now a days, it takes very long time to respond, sometime it doesnt send response at all.
Due to this, Synovia GPS data import process in our application got stuck. 
I have identified additional parameter to handle the issue and added to API.

I checked the log file which I added while working on 08/16 fix. This helped to find an new solution.
I have defined a waiting time for Synovia response. If we don't get synovia response in 4 mins, then the new API call will be placed and old call will be written into log file. 
In this way, Synovia service will be up and running even if there is an issue on Synovia end with freezed API service calls.
Update is in staging. I need to test the update in Staging first.

I have turned off Zonar import for Riteway with Anubhav help.
I have added all the buses from district 46 to district 15's Riteway admin unit as part of production release.
I am not sure why the buses are missing here. I need to check.

WP-832 - 4h - 4.5h
I am working on this ticket.
I compared the district 20 buses against district 15' SCT unit. Realtime page shows 43 buses in district 20 and 41 buses in district 15(SCT unit). 
Those two missing buses are 0086SC & 0087SC. I have copied production data to staging db. These two buses are missing in district 20 realtime page as well.
I am able to recreate this issue in PrePro. I am looking into this.

I am working on this issue.
I checked the implemention of the arrival report. It works based on the admin unit selection. 
Similar thing is observed by Manasa in WP-564, please refer 04/19 & 04/20 comments.
In district 15, when we selects SCT admin unit, it consideres only SCT routes and reports in the UI 
and when we select 'All', it consideres all the routes and reports in UI. 
Similarly, in district 20, 'All' option is selected, so it reports all the routes.
I checked buses_assigned_to_schools table which is managed by update_school_bus_assignments cron, district 20 has all the routes and buses of district 15. 
That's why, we are seeing  all the routes of district 15.
We will discuss in the call.

I had a discussion with DBA Karthi on this task.

WP-846 - 5h - 6h
I worked on this issue.
I checked https://wheresthebus.com/admin/tablet_student_summary.php?district=20 report. It uses bus company dropdown and not admin unit. We could not follow this one. I checked other arrival reports like "All Schools (all buses arrivals)", "Depot Arrivals". No admin unit is there in drop down.  Those reports work with 'All' option in dropdown. So, I modified this arrival report logic to work with 'All' option in dropdown for district 20.
Update is available in prepro. Please check. I can see some numbers mismatch between district 15's SCT unit report and district 20 'All' report.
Regarding, district 46, we have already two admin units there. Need to discuss this one.

WP-862 - 1.5h - 2h
I worked on the issue.
Bus number 29B1313FS icon is not created because the bus number length. I checked this in Add Bus page of Bus Manager. 
A bus number length can be maximum 8 when it contains alphabets and numbers. This rule is applicable in icon creation as well. 
That's why, bus number 29B1313FS icon is not created. I suspect this bus number should be created by a cron and not from Bus manager.

I have checked the fucntionality of both the crons. check_udp_server functionality is given below.
1. Don't perform heartbeat checkup between Saturday 9 PM - Sunday 1 AM.
2. Check the heartbeat cron is active. Skip the process if it is paused.
3. Check the previous heartbeat cron is still running. If it is running, then send mail notification and skip the process.
		Subject : "Alert: UDP Server - Heartbeat check up cancelled.";
		Message : "Since the previous heartbeat check up cron is still running, the current heartbeat check up has been cancelled for UDP Server at <<DateTime>>";
4. If previous heartbeat cron is NOT running then,
	A. Log the cron start time.
	B. Get the last heartbeat time of the UDP Server using sql SELECT update_time FROM heartbeat WHERE ident='wtb_udpserver'
	C. If we are NOT able to get the heartbeat time value, then send mail notification on DB error.
			Subject : "Alert: Database error - unable to fetch heartbeat value for UDP Server";
			Message : "Heartbeat check up for UDP Server - unable to fetch heartbeat value from DB table 'heartbeat' at <<DateTime>>";
	D. If we are able to get the heartbeat time value then,
		i. Find the time difference between last heartbeat time and current time.
		ii. If the time difference is greater than 300 seconds(ie. 5 mins) then, send mail notification UDP server outage and restart UDP Server  using script /srv/scripts/restart_udp_server.sh
				Subject : "Alert: UDP Server outage";
				Message with date & time, duration and link to pause & activate the cron. Please refer email screen shot for more details.
	E. Log the cron end time.
check_udp_server2 follows same logic except few changes. 
1. In all mail notificaitons, it uses "UDP Server 2" instead of "UDP Server'.
2. In 4.B, it uses "wtb_udpserver2" to fetch last heartbeat time.
3. In 4.D.ii, it uses script /srv/scripts/restart_udp_server2.sh to restart UDP Server 2.

I am working on this issue.
I checked the issue with number of assigned route buses diference between district 15's 'SCT' admin unit Vs district 20 'All' as well as district 15's Riteway Vs district 46 'All'. There is a missing school geozone. 
School #167 is there in district 15 and it is not there in district 20 and 46. So, we are missing those assigned routes buses and it impacts the total route buses number.
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 
And, I also noticed some school geozone type of district 20 & 46 are different from district 15.
District 20 school geozone type MS
 !screenshot-3.png|thumbnail! 
District 15 school geozone type ES
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 
The school geozones and its type of district 20 & 46 should be same as in district 15. Looks like, those got modified after we copied school geozones of district 15 to district 20 and district 46.

WP-846 - 4h - 5h
I worked on this task.
I inserted the missing School #167  in district 20 and district 46. I checked the report in prepro, it is showing correct assigned route buses.
I discussed with DBA Karthi regarding geozone data update. We found following db table columns of many geozones from district 20 & 46, 
are not matching with district 15. 
1.geozone_name
2.school_type
3.center_point
4.poly_points_spatial
5.am_trip_routes
6.pm_trip_routes
7.begin_time
8.end_time
I think we can update the above columns excluding am_trip_route and pm_trip_route.
He found some of the schools are available in district 15 and not in district 20 & 46.
select * from geozones where district_id = 15 and geozone_type =1
 AND geozone_name NOT IN (select geozone_name from geozones where district_id = 20 and geozone_type =1)
order by geozone_name;

Worked with Manasa on testing. I will look into the observations.

WP-795 - 2h - 4h
I had discussion with Vinod and Vijendra. They said, it would be better to have hundreds of 'div's in realtime page html (browser) instead of downloading bus icon images from the server. Hence, I will move forward with 'div' based approach in POC, that is, creating a 'div' foreach bus icon and render over the map.

I am looking into the observations.
Before doing the production release yesterday,  I had taken back up for vehicle_ids, admin_bus_units, synovia_vehicle_mapping and current_position tables.
I checked the backup vehicle_ids, admin_bus_units tables for the missing buses, we are missing the buses there as well.

This is an existing issue. And, I am debugging this in staging.

WP-795 - 0h - 1h
Okay. Today, I did not get much time to look into the POC as I was working with Anubhav on testing zonar in staging environment as part of KT.
Next, I will work on updating the  sample code to load more number of markers over the map, then will work to load markers in thousands.

I worked on this task.
I checked log file for First Student - Plymouth Meeting contractor. I don't see any error messages over there.
I ran the zonar restart script again today. Actually, the script is not restarting zonar processes, because I saw the same process ids after the zonar restart.
So, I killed the zonar processes and started them. Now zonar processes are up and running, application is making API calls First Student - Plymouth Meeting 
contractor.But, no data found in the response, hence record counts show 0 in db.
Note : Every 5 mins email alert for zonar/synovia data check, has been enabled again.

I am working on this task.
The reason for missing bus numbers, is duplicate mobile ids in vehicle_table. The mobile ids of these missing bus numbers are there 
in vehicle ids table for other bus numbers.

In staging, I downloaded all the buses into temp table zonar_vehicle_mapping_First_Student___William_Penn. 
I dont see requested new buses in zonar response, that is new buses are not there in fleet_number column of temp table.

Today, I tried to get the requested zonar buses. I received 60 bus in full name 60-085594. This is formatted as 60FS as per current bus number logic for First Student William Penn. We already have 804FS (full name 804-90717).
We are still missing R-1783. How this bus number should be formatted once we get this?

WP-927 3h - 3h
I worked on this.
My observation :
Bus Hsp1 is a sub bus for bus 35. 
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 
Tracked status table is getting updated only for bus Hsp1.
 !screenshot-5.png|thumbnail! 
And, no tracking status details for bus 35.
 !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail! <screen shot>
I checked the rider status page wheresthebus.com/admin/rider_status.php?district=49 it is fetching tracking status data for bus 35. And, we are getting 'no info' message as there is no tracking data available for 35 in db table.
I believe same logic is followed in rider page.
As discussed, tracking data for Hsp1 and no tracking data for 35, is correct.
In rider page, 'no info' message is displayed when all the bellow conditions are met.
1.If FitTime has value 
2.If difference between FitTime value and current time value, is greater than 600 seconds(10 mins) 
3.If last_event_timestamp(from tracked_vehicle_status table) has no value 
I checked rider page, same conditions are there, but need to confirm when bus is running.

I cleaned up the driver images. I deleted old one and retained the new one based on image date. After clean up, we have 750 driver images.
Images are saved in app server and updated db using script. Out of 750 driver images, only 423 images are saved as rest of the driver do not have record in driver_details table. So, they are ignored.
I will check with Vijendra to sync these images to S3.
Vijendra is not available today. So, I worked with Suresh to upload the driver images to S3. Driver images are available in S3 for tablets.
Ryan, I think something is not correct with WP-938 Done update and driver image details are lost in driver_details table . After production release, 432 drivers had images and now only 34 driver have images in driver details table.
All the driver images are saved again in the database. Again, Suresh helped to upload driver images to S3.
As we lost some of the driver pictures that we saved in our db initailly, are restored again.
Now, totally we have pictures for 569 drivers.

I checked the Memcache implementation of bus data from vehicle_ids db table. This is fine. But, I observed the Memcache key used here, has been used in a common php script as well. It is expected to be unique. So, I have changed the cache key in automatic model creation class file. This might be the reason for not getting the updated bus data.

New report is based on assigned route numbers, we need to show the assigned routes and buses even if there is no arrival. 
Shall I display the assigned routes as first column in UI table.
2. How to show routes that is assigned with multiple buses? We are showing comma seperated buses in "All Schools (assigned buses)" report.

New state tiger import is not done in tiger2. I discussed with DBA Kathi and found we are missing tiger configuration in AWS.
We need few postgres extensions to get new tiger state data. These extensions are just installed in AWS tiger servers and not configured. Because of that, tiger import did not happen. I have identified the configurations that need to be done in tiger machine to get new tiger state data.
Version of postgres extensions installed in AWS tiger servers, are higher than what we had in Linode. AWS postgres extensions comes with 2015 tiger data by default. Currently we have 2013 tiger data for all the downloaded states. We need to update AWS postgres extension to download 2013 tiger data.

Loos like, managing new esn for the buses, is not handled in existing synovia mapping cron.
I suspect, esn update causing the issue in bus tracking.

I checked the raw GPS message, Synovia does not send GPS number. But, it send the GUID of vehicle that we have in mobile_id column of synovia mapping table.
Screen shot GPS
GPS ids start with 48 is the latest id from Synovia API.
screen shot new ESN
So I updated the latest gps ids in db only for those buses refers old gps id. I have done this only for WC buses. 
After the update, GPS data started updating for WC buses.
Please check.

WP-983 - 4h - 5h
I worked on this.
1)I checked vehicle info for LN, LS and DB bus companies in vehicle_ids table. I compared the GPS id of vehicle table with mapping table.
GPS ids of vehicle_ids table match with mapping table for LN, LS and DB buses. So, GPS id is not updated in vehicle_ids table.
I observed one thing. Only for WC, Synovia asset mapping API sends all buses with ESN starts 48. In other bus companies LN, LS and DB, Synovia API still sends ESN with 48 and 43 as well. 
LS API reponse with 43

LS API reponse with 48

Memcache is not causing issue here. In this class file, only bus numbers are stored in memcache. 
Most of these bus number are modified on 28th & 29th of Oct. 
https://www.wheresthebus.com/admin/past_gps_assignments.php?district=50
And, updated bus numbers are available in memcache.
Looks like, there could be an issue with functionality of automatic model creation for the missing models.
I discussed with Ramesh.

-----------
WP-948 - 2h - 3h
I am working on this.
1.I had discussion with Ramesh and DBA Karthi on showing plan time in the new report.
Clarifcation:
When a bus has multiple plan times, then how to show that in report. Example, your's yesterday(11/19) comment on WP-984. Bus 324 has three plan times.
1. 8:50 A.M.
2. 8:47 A.M.
3. 11:50 A.M.

This new report is created as the Individual School Arrival report version of All Schools (assigned buses) report. It uses school bell time for arrivals.
As we discussed in Skype call today, this new report needs to be modified to find the arrivals based on plan time of each bus. 
This report would be the Individual School Arrival report version of New All School Arrival Report based on Planned Arrival time WP-984.
We will continue working on this ticket after WP-984 gets completed as we can use some of the logic and implementations from there.

I am working on this.
I discussed with the team about this issue. 
I checked the SVN logs as well as checked with the team, there is no recent release that can impact realtime page.
I am looking into existing code. Master icon files are not issue. I removed master icon files and checked the realtime page performance, it did not improve.
And, student search data(student button) is not issue. I removed student data loading in realtime page, performacne did not improve.
I am checking other parts of realtime page.
I discussed with Vijendra about the realtime page issue. His observations/suggestions are given below.
1. CPU and Memory are normal when we run realtime page for large customers.
2. We can try accessing the images directly from S3. Need to check the php work involved for this change.
3. Ajax calls need to be reviewed for late start buses, unassigned buses.
4. Need to find the total memory taken for the realtime page by the browser.

22-Nov-2018
-----------
WP-997 - 6.5 - 8h

I am working on this.
I removed late start buses and unassigned buses ajax calls and tested, it is not causing the performance issue.
Also checked geozones in realtime page, it is not causing the performance issue.
I tried calling the images directly from S3. These images includes bus icons, other tiny UI images. It did not help to resolve the performance issue we are currently facing with realtime page.
Looks like the handling/processing the background data(15 secs realtime data) in client side(web browser) is causing the performance issue like click actions when we load all the buses of large customers. And, left side bus table and map data are based on this background data. 
Need to check this code/implementation for any quick fix can be given.

I restarted the Zonar process. Zonar api calls are working correctly for all contractors including the above 5 contractors. I checked in db and logs as well.

WP-997 - 6h - 6h
I am working on this.
I looked into the implementation of processing background data(15 secs realtime data) where left bus table and right map updates are happening.
We have two issues in performance. 
1. Large delays between a button click and its response(freezing state for sometime).
2. Page is loading for forever.
#1 Based on the debugging, it is happening from updating bus table and map data. And, major contribution is from updating bus table data. I have started looking into optimizing the bus table data update.
#2 This is not consistently happens. I am checking this as well.

Earlier, there was a confusion on UDP restart from java team end, whether restart is required or not while setting up a new district. Hence, we used to restart the UDP as a standard practice(document), when we set up a new district.
Looks like, UDP restart is not required going forward. We can remove UDP restart point from document.

WP-1034 - 8h
I am working on this.
I have updated latest zonar gps functionality code to staging environment. It was very old earlier.
I have promoted the zonar gps updates for district 55 to staging and testing it .
I will update the ticket after the call.

Admin unit is changed to "Dattco".
District 55 zonar is working fine in Staging. 
I could not see the realtime data in realtime page as Dattco buses are not running. Dattco buses are not moving in district 26 as well.
Please check the updates in staging.

WP-1034 - 4h - 4h
This is promoted to Production. 
District 55 zonar setup done in production and District 26 zonar is enabled.
I need run the zonar cron and check the functionality in producton.

Dattco admin unit is added to district 55.
I ran the zonar asset mapping cron in production. It is working fine. Dattco buses are not driving, so no data in realitme page. 
Bus icons were created successfully. Icons will be plotted in realtime page map when we start getting GPS data.
District 26's zonar API calls started resuming. We got few email notifications on zonar data feed import. Emails stopped automatically once the release is settled in producton.

WP-1045 - 3h - 4h
I discussed with Vijendra on this issue and no connection time out parameter is set for zonar api calls. Added CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT parameter with Vijendara's help.
As discussed with Ryan, timeout parameter is set to 30 seconds. We will change this value in future if the request is taking more time.

28-Dec-2018
-----------
WP-1045 - 6h
I will look into this issue.
I will discuss with Vijendra on this.

I worked on this. 
Yesterday, we set timeout value as 30 seconds. So, our application will be waiting for 30 seconds when zonar system is down. This can cause the CPU load.
I checked for timeout options. CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT is a timeout for connection establishment means connection phase and not for data transfer.
https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT.html
So, we can set this timeout value minimal. I set this value t0 3 seconds in production and confirmed with Vijendra. 
This will fix the CPU load issue when zonar system is down.
Tested zonar import with current timeout settings. It is working fine. We need to monitor when buses are driving.

Bus number for the route, is fectched from the bus_route_info table and it is managed in bus_route_info_AM & bus_route_info_PM crons.

I am working on this.
1) I checked the missing buses from vehicle_ids table. They are missing in synovia mapping table as well. 
I ran the synovia import manually in staging for testing. We are not getting these buses from Synovia API. Import data from temp table.

And, I also used a soap utility tool to get XML response from Synovia API. These buses are missing in Synovia XML response as well.
'0568' is expected route number for 1753DB bus. And, bus_route_info table has '568' as route number, leading zero is missing here. It has to be same like '0649' previous record in sql result.

Driver images are saved in db tables on 10/11/2018 using a php script from WP-739. Images are saved correctly for given drivers with thier driver ids. No issues from this. 
 After that we did not run this script to save the driver images.
I can see driver images are getting updated from other two sources.
1. UI : https://www.wheresthebus.com/admin/employee_info.php?district=31
2. Employee import cron.
I am looking into this.
Found list of drivers having incorrect images(duplicate pictures) in produciton db table. And, those driver pictures are removed from db table. Hence incorrect pictures would not appear after next tablet sync. 
Next, I need to find any of these drivers having their picture in driver image folder.
If it is available, then I need to assign the picture to them in db table.

17-Jan-2019

WP-1063 - 6h
Yesterday, I set null values to both driver_image and image_modified_date db table columns for affected drivers. Today, I updated the image_modified_date with correct timestamp. 
I had a discussion with Shilpa on removing pictures for affected drivers from tablets. Setting null value in driver_image and updated value in image_modified_date, will not remove incorrect driver pictures from tablets during sync. So, we decided to set default driver picture in driver_image column and updated time value in image_modified_date, will help here. Default driver picture is an image shown on the tablet when no picture is assigned to the driver. 
I have modified driver_image & image_modified_date for this. And, checked with Prena, she confirmed default driver picture is displayed on the tables for the affected drivers.
And, also I checked the affected drivers have their pictures on the application server. Only one driver has image on the server. It is assigned to him in db. 
Driver details are given below.

Add/remove zonar buses for contractors are handled in code. Since, we don't want these two zonar buses get imported, it needs to be handled in the code. 
The code update is done in staging and currently testing it. We can promote to production once it is fine there.
This needs to be handled in zonar asset mapping cron logic. It marks two buses as deleted, removes entries from vehicle_ids table, and also updates admin units table.
This cron uses 'deleted' column to mark it as removed. I think, manually_removed should be other purpose.

I checked new update in staging. It is working fine.
Two buses do not appear in realtime page. And, also they also removed from vehicle_ids and admin units.

Hence, I manually updated column (manually_removed, inserted_vehicle_ids) then, ran the zonar import process again. 
14 Out of 16 buses appear in realtime page as we receive fleet number with dash. 
Two fleet numbers "3161 152055" & "3171 152056" still don't have dash. So they two dont appear in realtime page.
manually_removed and inserted_vehicle_ids were set to 0 like we did earlier for district 31 - Durham.

It is difficult to find the issue causing in the wait state from the current log. And, also could not able to reproduce it using test script.
I added php system error loging here. Hope this will help us to find the issue causing in the wait state.
Will look into the logs when zonar issue happens next time.

I worked into this ticket.
We fixed this issue in staging earlier. And, this is not currently working in staging as we are missing a db update.
I have done the db update again in staging. I checked and it is working fine now, we are able to add the deleted tablet in staging.
[~suhas_s] can do a round of testing.
This needs to be promoted to PrePro and Produciton at same time.

WP-1118 - 4h 
I worked on this.

I checked the current logic used in the report.

We are considering the tablet messages received in heartbeat table between 12AM and 5AM with sequence number 1 or 2 to find realtime/delayed heartbeat. 
If the time difference between created_date and log_date is less 240 seconds, then it is considered as realtime heartbeats (Real-Time), 
else it is considered as delayed heartbeat(Delayed ). 
Other tablets are marked as no heartbeat (Not Received).

Sql query used to find realtime / delyaed heartbeat:
SELECT ti.tablet_info_id, ti.bus_number, thb.latitude, thb.longitude, 
CASE WHEN (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(thb.created_date) - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(thb.log_date)) < 240 THEN 'Realtime' ELSE 'Delayed' END AS heartbeat_status
FROM wtb_app_live.tablet_heart_beat thb
LEFT JOIN wtb_app_live.tablet_session ts ON thb.tablet_session_id = ts.id
LEFT JOIN wtb_app_live.tablet_info ti ON ti.tablet_info_id = ts.tablet_info_id 
WHERE ti.district_id = '15'
AND ti.bus_company_id = '2'
AND ti.is_deleted != 1
AND FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(thb.log_date) + (-3600)) >= '2019-02-26 00:00:00'
AND FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(thb.log_date) + (-3600)) <= '2019-02-26 05:00:00'
AND (thb.sequence_no = 1 OR thb.sequence_no = 2)
ORDER BY ti.tablet_info_id ASC, thb.sequence_no DESC

I dont know to find realtime/delayed/no hearbeat counts from tablet manager. Will dicuss.

I worked on this.
Yesterday, synovia systems were down till 1.45pm. So, we did not get response from synovia.
Our application started collecting data automatically when synovia was up without restarting.
We did not get PM data for WC buses from Synovia. But, we get data for other contractors in daily_events table.
DB - 56,219 records
LN - 95,426 records
LS - 17,352 records
We have not received PM data for 2891WC bus. Last message received 2/27/2019 7:16:05 AM.
We will check today when buses are running.
We faced issue with Synovia GPS api service today as well. We had issue with both LBW & ICSB customers.
We are getting success message with no data in response.
<app screen shot>
I validated this from a third party utility (out of WTB application). We are getting same response.
<utility screen shot>
I checked synovia document, it says parameter 'Code = 1' means it is success and no data returned from synovia system.

68B564C6-2322-41EC-808E-6306DCD83E85 is not API key, this is GUID represents customer account, this should be unique and not supposed to change.
This new GUID belongs to ICSB.
 !screenshot-6.png|thumbnail! <customer_new>
Still current GIUD works with ICSB.
 !screenshot-7.png|thumbnail! 
I checked vehicle asset of ICSB with new and current GUID. Both response are same.
New:

Current:

New GUIDs for ICSB is not pulling data from Synovia.
 !screenshot-10.png|thumbnail! 
I checked, customer GUID is used in synovia_vehicle_mapping and also in import table synovia_data_information.
If they confirm only new GUIDs will be used in future, then need to think about current data update in mapping table and work on it. I need to do this first in staging.  
Looks like, synovia is still working on their api services. I think, we can wait till synovia system becomes stable.

I am working on this.
We are using wsdl file for calling api services, which Vijendra generated earlier. I discussed with Vijendra and requested for updated wsdl file. 
He has provided the updated wdsl file, I need to test this file from application.
Since we are going to use new api s0113 for gps data. This requires code change . I need to do this first in staging and test.
Need to check s0113 response with old s0105, need to handle that if there is different.
it will need addition code update in result parsing logic if it is different.
I worked on this.
I checked synovia old and new documentations for s0105 & s0113. It should work fine with s0113.
I checked the new wsdl file in utility and then from application. It is working fine.
I have done required code changes and moved to updates to staging. I ran the synovia import manually in staging as we dont have cron configurations for wtbuser.
I checked import is working fine in staging.
<screen shot>
I ran synovia vehicle asset import process in staging, I don't see any error/warnings, seems like it is works fine.
I tested in staging for gps data with new s0113 API. We are getting 01/01/2019 data from synovia when we request for latest data.
<screen shot>
Sometime, Synovia does not reply for LBW contractor.
<screen shot>
Note: I tried passing last id result of s0105 to s0113, it is pulling latest data in staging.
As discussed in skype, I have released the synovia update to production to use s0113 for GPS data collection. And, it will start collected data based on last id returned from s0105. 
I checked the update in production. It works fine. 
We are getting latest data for LBW contractor. But, synovia sends delayed gps data(3hrs) for ICSB contractor.

I promoted the updates to production. Update is working fine. We are collecting gps data for ICSB with new guid. As of now, we are getting realtime data only for 2 WC buses. Need to monitor.
<screen shot>
As we discussed over skype, I added fleet guid parameter to s0113 only for ICSB contractor. The code updates are first done in staging and tested then promoted to

2. School name is not being displayed in Excel
This is addressed. And also, we were missing school type (ES,HS,etc) in UI. This is also addressed.
3. In school_assigned_buses_arrival_report in excel the sheet & File name is being displayed as 'Arrival Time Performances'
Since this new report follows individual school arrival style, same name is used in excel. Now, I have changes the excel file name to "School Arrival Times Report".
Is the new file name okay? Please confirm.

I am working on this.
I checked the zonar documentations regarding missing output values. Log version 3.7 supports missing response values except 'loadts'.
'loadts' value represent the time the gps message received in zonar system. This value is stored as 'Stamp' value of GPS message in our application. Zonar system api does not support 'loadts' value in CSV format. It supports only message time this is similar to UpdateTime in our application.
https://support.zonarsystems.net/hc/en-us/articles/360016205232-Export-a-Path
Since, we are missing 'loadts' in CSV format, shall we can consider the current time that we store the message in db like our GPS message?
CSV formate Heading & Reasons are need to be mapped to json as they are different.
screenshot-3.png
screenshot-4.png
And also, We have data structure in JSON format, we are receiving the events in a logical group. that is,all the events of a bus, are grouped under that bus. And, all the buses are grouped under assets. Zonar data processing logic is coded on this data structure.

CSV doesn't support data structure. We need to modify the zonar processing logic for CSV format.

WP-1189 - 3.5h
I worked on this today.
I added sticker number to production db. And, I assigned sticker number values from excel.
District 31 has 180 school tablets production and 131 tablet's imei numbers matching with excel, got sticker number values in production db.
I have promoted latest sql changes to prepro environment and did some testing from my end. Data looks good.
 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail!

WP-1188 - 2h
I had discussion with DBA Karthi. 
Current 'a' query gives duplication in resultset. Please check sequence number 1085.
<screen shot>
Dataviewer:
<screen shot>
Which record should be fetched from db? 

I worked with DBA Karthik.
Update from DBA Karthik:
Query is tuned,now the results are returned in less than Milli seconds from 10minutes earlier. In case of duplicate sequence number the query will return the first record based on the id, irrespective of latitude and longitude.
For example : consider we have duplicate sequence number with different latitude and longitude as below
id seqno latitude longitude
91 101 373967316 -791711180
92 101 373967317 -791711182
93 101 373967318 -791711182
94 104 373967319 -791711183
In this case query will return the first record, (91 101 373967316 -791711180)
is this fine Ryan Hill ?

WP-1189 - 6h
I worked on this.
I have assigned sticker numbers for above 25 tablets in production db.

We have assigned sticker for 156 tablets so for. 5 are in deleted state, so we have 151 active tablets with sticker number.
 !screenshot-4.png|thumbnail! 
I worked on sql query to find the missing tablets. We were missing around 20 tablets those never sent event code 9 / event code 12 / no last report. This is because of filter values in sql. I have corrected it as we discussed over skype. Now, those missing tablet are reported with empty value in datetime columns. Now, it is reporting all 151 tablets.
 !screenshot-5.png|thumbnail! 
I have also added to show number of records at bottom of table.

We received 'Going To Sleep' with 7 meters at 4:05:48 AM.
<data viewer screen shot>
Hence, this meters is considered as last message of the day and 7 meters added to last value of vehicle_odometer.
Need to update the sql to consider the last message of previous day to find the distance covered. Currently, it just consideres last message.
Replying your quesetions:
#1 It adds 0 meters to vehicle_odometer table value.
#2 It adds meter value of last message (event code 19 - Going to sleep) to vehicle_odometer table value.
#3 It picks the last message of the bus(last driven day).

I am working on this.
I checked the logs for 14th, 15th & 16th June, odometer data was processed after 4AM EDT for district 61. 
This is the issue. And, also it took Friday(6/14) miles on Sunday(6/16) when Saturay(6/15) had just heart beat message with 0 Meters.
And also found that current sql uses daily_events table's id column to sort and pick the last message instead of using UpdateTime column.
Above two issues are addressed in the new fix. Now, cron will takes last message of previous day based on UpdateTime value and ordering. 
I tested this in local, it is working fine.
I had a discussed with DBA Naveena on optimization. He will work on that.
@Ryan, shall we promote new fix to Production or we can wait for Naveena to complete tuning?

I have received optimized query from DBA. I will look into this.

I worked on this.
I have completed zonar set up for "Durham South" contractor in district 15.
Buses of this contractor are saved to "Durham South" admin units.
In "Durham" (DH buses), bus numbers are formatted to four digits by prepending 0 in fornt.Hence, I formatted "Durham South" buses to four digits by preceding zeros.
I have promoted to staing. Need to test in staging both vehicle asset and gps data importing before production release.
Just to confirm, contractor id is dur4142, which is not working. And, contractor_id is dur4143 from given URLs, it works and used the same in zonar setup.

I am working on this.
I have paused notification email just to avoid receiving bunch of emails on this.
We have this issue because of some updates done on Synovia Systems side. I am checking from our end to make it work.
I need to discuss with Vijendra on this since he has provided the WSDL file for Synovia.

I had a discussion with Vijendra and his comment is given below.
"
Looks like the metadata of their service is changed and hence our processes are failing. Generally, we were generating WSDL files from their service 
discovery page at https://api.synovia.com/SynoviaApi.svc. Once after generating the WSDL file, we were using that file in our process.
But, today we found that they have disabled metadata publishing for this service. Hence, we can not generate the WSDL file. Now, we need either of the following.
1. Enable metadata publishing of their service on their website.
2. Send us the latest WSDL file.
It will be good if they inform us before making any updates on their side.

I am working on this. 
In new report, multiple arrivals of "Individual All bus arrivals", is not compatible with current structure and logic. I need to rewrite the logic to accomodata it. I am working on this.

I am working on this.
Multiple arrivals of "Individual All bus arrivals" are being reported in the new report. I have updated the logic.

screenshot-10.png
I have addressed the issue with arrival filters.
Clarification:
In "Individual Planned bus", arrival filter is checked against "Plan Time" instead of school bell time. Same thing is applied in the new report but we are not showing "Plan Time" column in UI table. Is this fine or should be change the arrival filter check against school bell time?
screenshot-11.png
Updates are available in PrePro.


30-Aug-2019
-----------
WP-1289 - 7.5h
I am working on this.
New column "Plan Time" is added to UI table and plan time data is shown.
Arrival filter works based on plan time for "Individual Planned bus" data and it works based on bell time for "Individual All bus arrivals" data.
Report for current data:
#1. Actually, one record comes from "Individual Planned bus" and another one from "Individual All bus arrivals" data. So, it looks like duplicate.
screenshot-12.png
#2. It is same like #1. 438 with route comes from "Individual Planned bus" data and 438 without route from "Individual All bus arrivals" data.
New filter "Late" is implemented. Arrival data is compared against the bell time to mark it as late(red text). Should we use "Plan Time" instead of bell time o mark it as late (red text) for "Individual Planned bus" data ?

---------------------------------------

WP-1289 - 7.5h - no jira
I am working on this.
#1. Duplicate entries are handled. If there are two rows with same arrival values, then only planned bus row will be shown.

screenshot-13.png
#2. I had a discussion with DBA Karthi regrading planned school arrival SP. Bus 438 is not there in planned_activities table. That's why, it arrival is not reported.
screenshot-14.png
I checked this in "All Schools : Planned buses vs. planned times" report. Bus 438 is listed in "no arrivals" pop up.
https://www.wheresthebus.com/admin/all_school_planned_arrival_time_report.php?district=24&startDate=08%2F26%2F2019&endDate=08%2F28%2F2019&action=Submit&daypart=AM&adminUnits=&schoolType=All&timeWindow=30&earlylatechk=1&earlylateHid=1&early=30&optimal=30&marginal=30

All the Admin unit names are updated to match what's in Zonar location field
I updated all the admin unit names to match with Zonar location field. And, also created missing admin units. All the Zonar locations are added to configuration file. Earlier, we added only the locations that got buses with gps id. Now, I added all the locations of Zonar API to config file including blank gps id location buses and created admin unit for them as well.

All the buses are assigned to the correct admin unit based on the location field
Buses with gps id, are correctly assigned to admin unit based on location.

I am working on this.
I checked today's nightly cron results for district 62. It got failed due to error. The error is due to special character in location. Zonar system renamed "Dvoraks LLC" to "Dvorak's Garage LLC". It is having single quote. It was not handled in zonar import process.
I have addressed the special character issue with location in staging and tested.
And also, zonar updated their other locations today.
Earlier locations with GPS id:

I am working on this.
I have addressed average issue with 301 bus.
Here, 08/26 arrival is 9.30 and plan time is 8.50. So the arrival should not be reported as arrival filter 30mins
New report:
screenshot-29.png
I checked the issue with "No Arrival" and "Unassigned" count of the new report.
screenshot-30.png
No Arrival:
No Arrival is calculated only for the expected bus(planned bus). Since bus 472 is not a planned bus, so, it arrival is not considered for route 161.
Unassigned:
We are counting the non plan buses (no plan time) that arrived. And, bus 472 is not a planned bus and it arrived. That's why it is counted.
In both 'No Arrival' and 'Unassigned' cases, bus 472 is not a planned bus (no plan time).

20-Sep-2019
-----------
WP-1289 - 7.5
I am working on this.
I have updated no arrivals logic. As we discussed, bus 472 arrival is considered for route 161 even though bus 472 is not from plan(no plan time).

I discussed with DBA Karthi. It is not returning the arrivals as there is no plan data for these buses in planned_activities table.
I checked the "All Schools : Planned buses vs. planned times". Arrival are not reported there.

I discussed with Ramesh on "All Schools : Planned buses vs. planned times" report. District 15 is not handled there.
In district 15, bus number in planned_activities and school arrivals are different. And, we are finding school arrivals based on bus numbers. That's why, arrivals are not reported.
For example, route 0034 to BRUCE ELEMENTARY school.

we are tracking only some of the locations WP-1168 Done .
South Windsor,New Canaan,Windsor,East Hartford,Manchester,Crec.
In District 31, we are tracking only below locations.
Philly Trans,Tacony,Home,UNKNOWN,MAT Bus Corp (PA),School Vehicle Division
Here, "School Vehicle Division" location buses are saved in Philly Trans – Orthodox admin unit, "Tacony" location buses are saved in "Philly Trans – Tacony" admin unit. Different location name is mapping to different admin unit. They have done some mapping logic is done.
Someother districts don't have admin unit based on location and it uses contractor name as admin unit. For example,
District 37 takes all the zonar buses(non numeric bus number) and saves in "First Student Buses" admin unit name.

In District 15, Lamers, Durham, Johnson, Durham South admin units are created with contractor name and all the buses are saved in respective admin units.

This is in-progress
Working on implementing the required updates. 
1. If new location is added with bus assignments in zonar system, then new admin unit will be created in our system with new location name and buses will be assigned to it.
2. If location is renamed in zonar system, then it would be done for admin unit.
3. If location is removed from zonar system, then respective admin unit will be deleted.
4. If location does not get bus assignments in zonar system, then respective admin unit will be deleted as no buses will be shown for the admin unit in school admin page. We have done this manually for few admin units "Brown SR Elkton, Brown SR PV, etc.." while working on WP-1345. Please ref comment "10/Sep/19 5:11 PM".

WP-1354 - 6h
I worked on this.
I promoted the updates to staging. I tested the functionality and it is working fine.
Outstanding thing is, we need to update the display order in admin units table in zonar import.
Just to confirm, we don't need to manually add/edit/delete admin units based on locations when we setup a new zonar district like district 62 in future.
If a district has multiple contractors, then we need to create admin units with contractor name or different name and save the buses to the admin unit. 
This will not follow the new location logic.

WP-1378 - 1h 
I will look into this next.
Do we need to format the bus number?

I looked into the issue.
Found that export to excel of Idle Report, was running in the background for long time and consuming more resources. This was causing the issue.
Php server status

I killed the process and php server load is back to normal.

I checked the report.
Maximum execution time of the php script, is relaxed in this report. So, it was running for too long time. We need to set a max allowed time in this report to avoid this in future.
Ryan Hill, What is the max time we can set for this report?

I am working on this.
#1 I had discussion with Karthi. I will work on this.
#2 This is added to the table.

I checked missing arrival issue bus # 1471LM. It's route # 0293. We have record in buses_assigned_to_school and in planned_activities tables.

We are using bus_route_info table to find actual bus number for the plan bus based on route number. Then, arrivals will be found for the actual bus number from school arrivals table.
Since, we don't have a record in bus_route_info table for the given route 0293, we are missing arrivals for bus # 1471LM.
screenshot-8.png
I checked with DBA Karthi on above findings. He confirmed it.
Prakash P, can you check please why don't have record for route # 0293 & bus # 1471LM?
Note: I can see a record with route # 0292 instead of route # 0293 for bus # 1471LM. Can it be a data issue?

Route # 0293 did not have 1471LM assignment on given day 10/04. So, showing bus # 1471LM to route # 0293 is incorrect. Like that, incorrect bus numbers are shown for other routes as well in assignment popup. I discussed this with Ramesh S

But still we are missing the arrival. We are not getting arrival data in SP results. I need to check with DBA Karthik on this.
Issue #2 - Incorrect "Arrival" time in popups
I checked the code. These are correct "Arrival" times in popup. They are calculated from "Plan Time" and not based on "Average Plan Time".
Eg.

I found an issue with integration of WP-1368 fixes. We have routes with no bus assignment in [all school planned arrival report.|http://prepro.wheresthebus.com/admin/all_school_planned_arrival_time_report.php?district=15&startDate=10%2F04%2F2019&endDate=10%2F04%2F2019&action=Submit&daypart=AM&adminUnits=&schoolType=All&timeWindow=45&earlylateHid=0&early=0&optimal=0&marginal=0]

 !screenshot-47.png|thumbnail! 
I have addressed this issue. Those routes appear in the report.
 !screenshot-48.png|thumbnail! 
Observation :
In db stored procedure for finding the arrivals, 'stop_time_sec' of planned_activities<db url> table is primarily used. 
And, we have incorrect data in 'stop_time_sec' column for merged districts.
<screen shot planned>
Here, district 46 'stop_time_sec' is expected to be same as district 15, 20. Due to this, we are not getting correct results in db stoped procedure.
I discussed this with DBA karthi and handling this in SP will take more effort.
The root cause for this different 'stop_time_sec' is plan data import cron timing. It is 11.55PM 
District 15 & 20 completed on 11/06 11.56PM & 11.58PM respectively and district 46 completed at 11/07 12.04AM.
I discussed with Prakash, this issue can be sorted out if we prepone the plan data import cron time. Can we set it 11.30PM. 
So, that 'stop_time_sec' will be same as cron would be finished before 12AM.

08-Nov-2019
-----------
WP-1289 - 3.5h
Okay.
I checked plan import cron. I can see district 15, 20 & 46 are in different positions(execution order). We can put them together, this will further help here. I will do this when I update the plan stop import cron time.

21-Nov-2019
-----------
WP-1454 - 7.5h
I am working on this.
#2. I checked this issue. We are missing midday arrivals due to two different forms for midday(MD & MID) in route value.
For example, Bay View HS
screenshot-3.png
We have arrival for "9010 MD OUT" and it is not appearing on the report.
school arrival db:
screenshot-4.png
Bus 0085SC ran on "9010 MD OUT" based on bus_route_info table.
screenshot-5.png
Bus 0085SC is not shown in new report for route "9010 MD OUT" and we are also missing its arrival. This is because, we have "MID" in bus_route_info and "MD" in planned activities
screenshot-6.png
and buses_assigned_to_school db tables.
screenshot-7.png
Which one is correct either "MD" or "MID"? and should it be corrected in db table or should we handle this in program to consider both "MD" & "MID" are same. Ryan Hill, please confirm.


22-Nov-2019
-----------
WP-1454 - 7.5h
I am working on this.
#2. As we discussed, I have updated district 15, 20 & 46 routes value from "MID" to "MD" for 11/08 in bus_route_info table. After this update, I started seeing assigned bus number for midday routes in new report and also its arrivals.
screenshot-9.png
Still we are missing arrival for 0085SC, that I am looking into the issue.
#3 Missing plan data eg 9009 MD OUT for Audubon HS. I checked this issue. We are missing the plan from db stored procedure. I will discuss with DBA Karthi on thi.
Sometime, we are missing the plan in All School as well. DB stored procedure results are not stable here. I will check with DBA Karthi.

I looked into this.
I tried stopping zonar import from super user (root) and starting from wtbuser account many times in app server. But, It did not work out. It was giving permission denied error.
I let the zonar import continue running from super user account.
I will check with Vijendra and proceed further here to run from wtbuser account as it was running earlier before server restart.

#5. I am working for new UI to show the past tablet assignment history. And, I also need to link this new UI to “MDT Mgr. History” button  after "Unassigned MDT". 
Just  to confirm, we are showing "Bus Mgr. History" (vehicle logs) link only to below users. 
- Super Amin
- District Admin
- Trans Manager
- Technician
- Real-Time Only with Bus Manager
And, same access privileges  should be applied to show “MDT Mgr. History” button correct?

	I am working on this.
	I checked the duplicate issue for 1287RW bus in new report. Bad data of 1287RW is the root cause of this issue. We have duplicate entry for 1287RW bus in bus_route_info table.
	screenshot-20.png
	Bus 1287RW belongs to district 46 and it is expected to have entry in bus_route_info table only for district 46. We had entry for district 15 as well. This is incorrect data in bus_route_info table. I have deleted incorrect entries of 1287RW from bus_route_info for 11/04. And, new report is working fine now.
	screenshot-21.png
	I discussed bus_route_info issue with Prakash P. He found this is related to WP-1452 Done . We do not have incorrect records for district 15 with district 46's bus numbers after we fixed WP-1452 Done .

As discussed, I have updated sql query to use assigned_route column to check route assignments from geozones.
1. Now, missing swap buses appear in the school view page.

2. This works with normal bus as well.
Link:

3. I could not check the cover bus as there is no such assignments currently.
4. Sub bus is not working correctly. It shows the bus that is not running for the day.
Eg. Bus 543 is subbed for 316 in route 2539. It shows bus 316 instead of bus 543.
School view:

-----------
WP-1420 - 7.5h
I worked on this.
We are missing sub bus 543 in school view sql query results. That's why, sub bus is not appearing in the UI.
screenshot-11.png
We are missing sub bus records in result set due to route filter on school route assignments. This filtering should be happening on php logic in order to work correctly for sub bus. Hence, I removed the route filter from sql query and implemented in php logic. Now, sub but is working correctly.
School View Sub bus:
screenshot-12.png
Removing route filter from sql and new php logic is not affecting swap bus. It works correctly.
School View:
screenshot-13.png
Above changes are only for district 31.
I had discussion with Ramesh S on above updates.
Is there separate logic for district 31?
There is no separate logic for district 31 sub buses. This wasn't working due sql filter.

I am working on this.
I have come up with a plan to work on this. I will discuss this plan with Vijendra tomorrow.
1. UI updates in school admin page to save settings value like parameter, email, etc.
2. Process to monitor gps messages and save speeding alerts to new db table 'speeding_alerts'.
3. Process to send email alerts to users by reading from speeding_alerts db table.
#1 UI updates:
a. Need to add 'Has Speeding Alert' option in 'Early Release:'. So, the districts enabled with this check box option, will be tracked for speeding alerts.
b. Need get X & Y values below 'Has Speeding Alert'.
c. Need to add 'Speeding Emails' section with 'Send mail' option & 'From Address' dropdown selection.
d. Need to add 'Send Speeding Emails To:' section below 'School District Settings' section to get comma separated Email ids. This is accessible to district users.
#2 Monitoring & Saving Process:
We can have a db stored procedure, which will be called by php script at a fixed time interval(Eg. every 5mins) to monitor & find the speeding alerts that meet both X &Y parameter values and it will save them into speeding_alerts db table. I had discussion with DBA Karthik on this.
#3 Sending email alerts:
we need to create a php process to check for new alert and send email notifications independently.
New db table 'speeding_alerts' structure. We can add if anything is required.

24-Dec-2019
-----------
WP-1472 - 7h

I am working on this.
I have listed the things need to be done here.
1. Ability to run multiple reports concurrently.
2. Allow only X number of report/realtime/history pages can be opened concurrently.
3. Ability to find user closes browser window while request is being serviced(on page load)
#1. As discussed earlier with Vijendra, this can be done by explicitly releasing the lock in required pages.
#2. Just to confirm, once the concurrent pages are served, then user can open other report/realtime/history pages. We need to configure X parameter and need a logic to serve only X number of pages at a time. This needs to be implemented in required reports, realtime & history pages.
#3 I checked this. Looks like, we don't have method in php script to find tab/browser closure while it is being served(on page load). I will discuss with Vijendra on this.


26-Dec-2019

WP-1472 - 7h
I am working on this.
#2 It is little challenging to track the status of 3 concurrently running report pages and to put 4th report on hold if X is parameter value is 3. I got the logic to implement this. It is check the status of concurrently running report pages at selected time interval say for eg. 10 secs (configurable) based on their status, we will decide to allow/hold other new reports execution. I have done some sample scripts on this. Currently, I am testing this one and will implement it for few reports along with #1. We will check that and then I will move on to implement it for other reports.
#3 I did not get time to discuss with Vijendra today.

WP-1514 - 2h
I have done code review with Savitha and I have 2 concerns.
1. New db column 'cur_time' is created to save the expiry time of forgot password hash key. This new column is not required as expiry time is already being a part of hash key and which can be decoded to fetch expiry time.
2. Please rename new db column from 'hashkey' to 'forgot_pwd_hashkey'.
Will this impact the forgot password process from the parent apps using the iOS and Andriod apps?
Need to discuss with Mobility Team.
I helped Savitha and addressed the issue with decoding hash key and fetching expiry time.

I worked on implementing the new fix for report tracking issue. This is done for below 4 reports. For testing, I have set 2 as max report pages can be opened at a time. If we open 3rd page, it will be in wait state.
All Schools Arrival Reports :
1.All bus arrivals vs. bell times (interactive, any date range)

WP-1515 - 6.5 h
I am working on this.
My understanding is, so far we are giving user access to modules based on role. Going forward, we need to give user access based on module permission granted to the user rather than role based. We are going to introduce this feature for district 31 first and it would be given to other districts in future.
I worked on this and have come up with a plan.
1. Need to introduce 'HasUserSpecificAccess' check box in school district setting.
2. For the districts enabled with #1, we need to show new column 'Permissions' in 'Manage Users' UI section. This new column will be a multi select drop down and we will show modules to be granted to users like 'Employee'.
3. Need to create a new db table to save user Vs module permissions. I need to work little more on this. It will be like geozone Vs bus assignment db table(buses_assinged_to_geozone_alert) for geozone alerts.
4. Need to update 'Employee' button code in realtime page. So that, this button will work normaly to other district and this button will be shown for district 31 only if user has access to 'Employee' module.
Just to confirm, we need to give exclude super admins from above permissions.

Based on yesterday's geozone_querys.csv from Prakash, I have a suggestion here to prevent table level lock in future. Geozone db table uses MyISAM engine where other tables have InnoDB engine.

MyISAM locks entire table while performing its operations called table-level locking, where InnoDB locks only the required rows called row-level locking. In this way, yesterday, most of the queries went into wait state "Waiting for table level lock" for a very long time, becuase of table-level locking performed by MyISAM engine.
We need to figure out,
1. Why do we have MyISAM engine for geozone table.
2. Based on #1, we need to find the possibility to migrate gezone db table from MyISAM to InnoDB.
Need to work with DBA on this.

WP-1547 - 5h
I have started looking into this.
I have some clarifications. will discuss in call.
Just to confirm,
1. New school admin setting to enable/disable whole "Child Check" report section correct?
2. We need to get event code 92 messages from daily_events_XX for this report correct?
3. Based on given report parameter, there are start & end day select. Since, it is single day report, do we need end day input?

WP-1513 - 2h
Today, we released WP-1525 Ready for Production , WP-1513 Ready for Production & WP-1525 Ready for Production ticket.
Ramesh S, Suhas Shetty and I worked on load test starting from 4:15AM EST. Altogether, we opened more than 200 srider pages concurrently. Queries from srider were not piled up and not shown in slow queries list.
As we intentionally did a load test, we got cpu spike to 99.5%. We feel like this is due to more number of queries in parallel and not due to query's execution time. Below, Csv was captured when we had spike on cpu.
db_server_queries_04_30_AM_EST.csv
New updates are in production and we expect no load on cpu from srider page.
We are monitoring server load. So far, the load is normal.

WP-1420 - 0.5h
This ticket WP-1420 Ready for Production is promoted to production along with two other tickets WP-1513 Ready for Production & WP-1525 Ready for Production . And, it works fine.

Updates are available in staging.

WP-1558 - 2h
Had discussion with Vijendra & Prakash. We have come up with high level plan.
We will have new db table.
shared_buses_between_district.xls
In school admin page, we will have a new section, where we will can assign comma separated bus numbers to a district. There will be separate rows for each district like we have bus assignments to admin unit.
Ryan Hill as we discussed in the call today with Vijendra,
1. We need to have code for the districts and that we need to append to the shared bus number.
2. There won't be report for these shared buses.
3. Bus history page will work for current day data for the shared bus.
4. Bus history page will work for past day data for the shared bus only if the sharing(assignment) exists in new db table.
I will look into this more tomorrow.

05-Feb-2020
-----------
WP-1558 - 7 hr
I am working on this.
I had discussion with Ramesh S.
Confirmation :
1. We will pass original district id & bus number in history page url like we do for merged district.
2. We need show formatted bus number(district code at the end) in history page as it is shown in realtime page.
Questions:
1. Are we going to share only route buses to other districts?
2. If sub bus runs for an inactive route bus which is shared to other district. What we need to show in other district?
Looks like, implementing this new feature in BusRealtime page would be complex one. I will take DBA help for the sql updates.

WP-1558 - 6h
I am working on this.
Since we do not have text appended bus numbers(formatted bus number) stored in db tables like vehicle_ids, current_positions tables, we can not save formatted bus numbers in admin unit table. So, we need to save original bus numbers. But, we can show formatted bus numbers in admin unit UI of school admin page.
I have done this update in my local and testing it. I will promote to staging before end of the day.
We are using formatted bus numbers in realtime page UI and planning to do the logical things with original bus number.
I have started looking into real time page updates.
Update on admin unit's bus number format:
I have completed testing bus number format for admin unit. I had few bugs and fixed. It is promoted to staging.
District 1:

- release -
- Ramesh & I worked on load test started at 4.15AM EST -
- intentional load test -  above 200+ tabs - 99.5% load. -
- srider queries are not there in long running queries. -
- attach excel. -
- we feel like load is because of more queries and not because of query execution time. 
- New updates are there in production and will monitor in business hours.

As discussed in scrum meeting, 
We have MyISAM db engine for Geozone table in database, where other tables have InnoDB engine. 
MyISAM does table-level locking where InnoDB follows row-level locking. We need to figure out,
1. Why do we have MyISAM engine for geozone table.
2. Possibilities to migrate gezone table from MyISAM to InnoDB.
Need to work with DBA on this.


Based on yesterday's geozone_querys.csv from Prakash, I have a suggestion here to prevent table level lock in future.
Geozone db table uses MyISAM engine where other tables have InnoDB engine. 
<screen shot>

MyISAM locks entire table while performing its operations called table-level locking, where InnoDB locks only the required rows called row-level locking. 
In this way, yesterday, most of the queries went into wait state "Waiting for table level lock" for a very long time,
becuase of table-level locking performed by MyISAM engine.
We need to figure out,
1. Why do we have MyISAM engine for geozone table.
2. Based on #1, we need to find the possibility to migrate gezone db table from MyISAM to InnoDB.
We need to work with DBA on this.

module access based on user permission and not on role based.
Only for district 31.

Best practice:
Modules in db table.
Populate Module from db.
Junction table to map user and module.

Questions:
How to map UI button text to db module name?
 - check Xref table before showing.

Modules in db with name & id
Xref table user_id & module_id
check user permission in Xref table before showing Mod button
District settings - HasUserSpecificAccess flag

-- Your understanding - need to give user access based on module permission assigned to the user than just on role based.
-- New district setting to enable permission to user specific.
-- Need new db table to save user Vs module permissions like geozone Vs bus assignment db table for geozone alerts.
-- New UI stuff to assign user to module.

all school assigned buses
student_rfid_report_summary.php




- Stream line the code
- implement  #1 & #2 in few reports
- Test in PrePro.
- Exclude ajax content once


Forgot password:
As discussed, hashkey generated for forgot password link contains timestamp. Please save the key in user table when user makes a 
forgot password request first time. Please use this key for validation when user tries to make multiple forgot password requests 
before it expires. Please clear this key in user db table on successfull password reset.





Observation:
- Php script continues execution even after the page is closed.
- Able to updates session at the end by reopening the session.
- Not sure above find the page closure while loading.

- Find php script closure / termination
- Check php scritp execution after page closure.

New Arrival report not working for all district 15 contractors. 

1.D – IAM roles for EC2 instances allow applications running on the instance to access AWS resources
without having to create and store any access keys. Any solution involving the creation of an access key
then introduces the complexity of managing that secret.

2. B, D – Both DynamoDB and ElastiCache provide high performance storage of key-value pairs.
CloudWatch and ELB are not storage services. Storage Gateway is a storage service, but it is a hybrid
storage service that enables on-premises applications to use cloud storage.

Why no of planned buses are different between individual and all school planned? eg Milwaukee Spanish Immersion  --
Why merging results did not happen? eg Milwaukee Spanish Immersion - bus number 0066SC to planned route 8197 and  also check with 0086SC Bay View school no 012
Clarify Ryan, why SC is shown on route?

current tabletools - not working. - student_nomatch_details.php
Check fix for the above two plugin.
Find new plugin with nested table compatibility and rowspan.

Temp 1:
$('#imgExportButton').click(function(e){
console.log($('#tableWrap').html());// wrapper div for table
                    //var dtltbl = $('#dtltbl').html();    
  window.open('data:application/vnd.ms-excel,' + encodeURIComponent(
		$('#tableWrap').html()
	));

Try for new jquery plug in with header.
Complete excel without summary using currently library.

Consider:
Show filters on top of excel.

- Store current row index into $tempRowIndex & tempSummaryRowIndex when you start school --
- Print Summary deatils with static col & incrementing row tempSummaryRowIndex
- and start printing bus, route, etc... using tempRowIndex and incrementing the same
- Once iteration is done, then merge bus, route, plan for 'All' and print 'All' values and increament tempRowIndex once.
- Check $tempRowIndex Vs $tempSummaryRowIndex values and set highest value to next school iteration's dataRowlIndex values.


Oustanding:
Highlighting red in excel. --
Set bold to internal summary headers.  --
Merge summary unused cells row vice. --
Fix spacing issues & width. --
Fix Alignment issues. 
Remove hand cursor for headers
Remove excess space from header row value
Change excel file name

Test with All school option.--
Test with min and max rows.-- 
Placing excel icon. (datatable / else seperate icon) --

This is causing issues in reporting correctly arrivals.



We are getting issue in arrival due to incorrect 'stop_time_sec' value 




-- In testing, I found we are missing arrivals of some buses in all school planned arrival report. I have updated WP-1368. This will impact this new report as we are using db stored procedures of all school planned arrival report.




- UI fix
- page loading error fix
- Missing empty bus number issue due to integration
- 

 
All school pal
- reproduce missing arrivals issue
- Worked on issue with DBA Karthi - found incorrect stop_time_sec in planned activity table, causing issue in SP and not returning correct data in results.
- Explain plan activity table processing issue.
- Quick fix is prepone to 11.30
- Discussed with Prakash.

Going forward:
- district 62 style - since it has no contractors and admin units in location
-
Contractor Districts :
Admin units are created for contractors and not for location
Do you need admin unit in location name not in contractor name?
What happen if same location is there in two different contractors?




going forward when we setup a new zonar district like district 62,

- Have an additional array in config file to find the districts having auto admin unit creations.
- Create isZonar created admin unit flag column in admin unit table.
- Find logic to add/edit/delete admin unit based on location updates from zonar api.
- Figure out way to handle user created admin units and auto admin units.
- Concern on code - where buses are saved to vehicle_ids based on location array.

Implementation:
- Get the list of locations(array) from zonar vehilce mapping table. 
- Get the list of zonar admin units(array) from admin units.
- loop zonar locations array
	- Check location is matching with zonar admin units array
	- If matches, then update buses and set a flag to both zonar location array item and zonar admin unit array item
- Delete unflagged zonar adming array items from admin units table.
- Clear zonar adming array
- Loop zonar locations array only unflagged items
	- Create admin unit with zonar location item name and update buses.
	- Flag zonar location array item.


- Check if the location is available in admin units table.
- Create if it is not available and store buses.
- If it is available, then update the admin unit.

//Move school arrival data to plan arrival data in sub bus data movement.

- Execute sub sql for routes --
- loog merged res as mrec --
- find mrec's bus & route matching with sql res sub & route 
- if matching, set sub = 1 & call setSubRoute(), then if mrec is plan data, then find and move school arrival data to mrec

Known challenges :
1. Additional fiter (skip arrival) individual school arrival report
	- Just ignore 'No of Visits' for now.
2. Merging two report's results.
3. Sorting because of 'colspan' for individual school 'All' summary
4. Manaing admin unit and bus list


Instructions:
First build the data structure based on assinged bus result data. -
Merge with school arrival data. - 
do the Avg arr & Avg for Avg & day(arr & dep) after merging. 
Use same $averageTotals array with school_no as additional and first index.


School arrival report:
Fetches arrival based on destination_id(comma seperated if merged district). line #96 & 100.

Assigned bus:
Uses destination_id in school dropdown

Notes:
$checkingBus is equivalent to $checkingBusTBLBusAssigned

I investigated the issue and found there is an invalid contractor 'dat1154' creataed for this district. No idea why it was created. 
We don't have this contractor in current configuration.

Just to confirm.
I will add new column lunch_id after bus_stop_time in student_details_upload, student_details & student_details_history tables.
We need to store lunch_id values only for district 30 in student_details_upload table and this new column will be null for all other districts.

Manual_rfid_no
0 and values stored as it is in lunch_id.
How NULL values should be saved?

lunch_id

null 8275698

1. Current state?
	Which column uses?
2. Proposed state?
If we have,
a.barcode value in stud_id
b.lunch_id in manul_rfid_no
Then why do we need new column for lunch_id ?
3. Bus History page?
4. Student Report? which reports?

Check the current student import crons?

I checked the new logs in production. 
We are logging the old odometer value returned by SP. I feel like having the new odometer value in logging, would help in debugging.
I have asked DBA Naveena to return the updated odometer value as well. He will look into that.

Clicking on "Delete Bus" should delete the bus when no ESN assigned
Delete ESN bus 
	-> clear bus#, route#, etc and set Status to Unassigned

963C548F-640D-4DC8-8E94-E7D242EE3C03

2)1554LN need to be deleted from vehicle ids table



I have fixed the issue. There was a logical issue in the synovia vehicle import process. And, the issue is there from the beginning (based on svn log) and other developer worked on this. I fixed missing bus number 1775 issue in staging. 
Missing buses are added in 
vehicle_ids
synovia_vehicle_mapping
admin_bus_units
current_positions

1775DB needs to be removed from db. That i have done manually in production db. 
We have two different issues here.
1. Missing new bus numbers.
2. Removing existing bus when it is no longer available.

#1 is fixed. 
#2 we need to handle this in the cron.

Can we use direct value in where clause instead of variable. Becoz, need to execute set variable as seperate statements. --
Remove version number & its table. --

* confrim - resetting manually_removed is solution.
* manuall remove bus from bus manager  - run the cron - check whether deleted buses are added back.

check where and all manually_removed is used.

set manually_removed = 0
manually_removed = 1 in bus number assignment where bus number is null.

we were missing those buses in realtime page as manually_removed = 1 and skipped in admin unit groups.

I added valid buses to East Hartford from zonar_mapping table in staging db. 
But, they do not appear in realtime as they don't have entries in vehicle_ids table.

If it is very urgent, i can spend some more time to look into the zonar process to make it work.

Barath :
9) District time zone change from php UI
10) Route update in daily_events table (WP-1140)
11) Log files path of UDP & Workers
12) Mail notifications(important & ignore)
13) Access to UDP Server (Vijendra)
14) Location of java code in UDP Server


Access to UDP server
What needs to be done on UDP when district time zone is changed from school admin page. 
	- I believe we need to restart the UDP & workers.
How the route assignment is done by UDP.
	- SELECT MobileID, BusNumber, route, district_id FROM vehicle_ids where non_udp_data = 0.
	- Route number are updated in hash map every minute by UDP.

This is not api key, this is customer GUID - this should be unique id and not supposed to change once it is generated by Synovia.

Confirm new key of ICSB
	-- Yes
Check gps data pull with new key belongs to ICSB
	-- To check this compare vehicle asset of both old & new keys
		-- Vehicle asset - Same in both keys
	-- 
	-- Not getting data with new key
	-- We are getting data with old key
Check impact of key change in config file
	-- Old key referred in synovia mapping table
	-- Validating gps data with mapping table on key

synovia mapping table liked with customer guid. Also, need to check fleet_id and mobile_id GUIDs once synovia system is stable.
If they confirm only new key will be used, then need to work on this first in staging. 

Looks like, synovia is still working on their api services. I think, we can wait till synovia system becomes stable.

Why manual delete got set?
Not sure.

How to get back the buses?
- set manually_removed = 0 and inserted_vehicle_ids = 0 
- run the zonar import bus process

Why we are missing from vehicle_ids table and admin_units?

Are these buses in vehicle_ids?
- No

No zonar import means - should be hanled in code.
add/remove buses in zonar import - handled in code - so that, bus will not be imported from zonar.
Db column should be for other purpose.







010002 -> 030004

Debug in produciton
Match staging code to prod and test in staging
	automatic_model_creation.php code is same.
	AutomaticModelCreation.php code is same.
	common.php code is same.
	
Proceed further logic in staging.






Autimatic model issue:
Check the buses are getting listed when we select model date and AM/PM?






List of tables involves in automatic model creations ::
districts
admin_bus_units
macro_models -- mid table 56K records
geozones
daily_events
routes
model_routes -- big table 22L records
settings
stops -- mid 1L records
----------------
model_update_log


List incorrect drivers.
Clear driver images & modified column.
Assign correct images if it is available in server.





Not an issue from save driver images WP-739. All reported images are updated after oct 2018

May be from UI / employee import cron.


Report images in server?

Truncate table.
More buses to tracker 5 not just 100 buses.
-- Need to confirm this is causing issue before implementing
-- For one day, will make district 16 like other district trackers

Individual school report - plan time - STABLE in production - otherwise need to fix issue in individual report as well.

Next, task??

Question
Remove 5 trackers concepts for Austin and run like other districts?
Revert immediatly if we face any issues with that?


Observation :
12-Dec-2018 - 0616 ran only for PM trip and NO log entries and NO bus number in tracking bus list & non-tracking bus list as well.
tracker_run_details - that is, multiple trackers within a district - application only to District 16.

Clarifications:
How - Bus Number list array works for a tracker?
How - Bus Numbers are framed - on what basis?
When - Bus Numbers are cleared? **
When - emptying the tracker_run_details happens? **
Check - 0616 in logs & bus number list during its PM trip
Check - reason behind multiple trackers for district 16 (mail & jira)
After AM trip - trackers are paused or killed - before PM trip


Observation :
13-Dec-2018 - 0616 ran both AM and PM and tracked - 0610 is available in tracable list.

Suspect :
Clear bus array after AM trip
Clear tracker_run_details only when district 16 ends
Handle all the remaining buses in tracker number 5

'0955

clearQueue-0955
No entry for PM trip - 06 & 07

clearQueue-0616
entry for AM & PM trip - 06

0616 - gets into a new tracker log when there is pulled out.
